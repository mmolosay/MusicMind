/**
 * Finite scale represents a musical scale as materialized list of entries of type [T] (notes or pitches).
 *
 * Finite scale may be not full, if an instrument in which context it was materialized can't produce all notes of
 * scale's definition.
 *
 * This type of scale contains every entry of the scale __without__ an octave entry, which is an entry `(n + 1)`
 * in an `n-sized` scale and is a tonic but one octave higher.
